# Colony detector
Script to detect bacterial colonies from an image file containing petri dishes. The script contains
- dish detection for detecting and cropping the dishes
- preprocessing in order to minimise the adverse effects of heterogenous lighting
- the colony detector itself. 
- Additionally, the script contains a .pdf scraper in order to compare its readings to those of an Interscience colony counter.
